# High Availability HAProxy with Keepalived Setup on CentOS 7

Welcome to this GitHub repository that offers a comprehensive guide and all necessary configuration files for establishing a High Availability (HA) solution using HAProxy and Keepalived on CentOS 7.

Description:

The provided guide and configurations empower you to create a robust infrastructure that ensures smooth operation and minimal downtime for your web services. By implementing this setup, you'll achieve load balancing and automatic failover capabilities, enhancing the availability and reliability of your applications.

Key Benefits:

This setup delivers the following advantages:

Load Balancing: HAProxy efficiently distributes incoming web traffic among multiple backend servers, optimizing resource utilization and enhancing performance.

Automatic Failover: Keepalived manages a Virtual IP (VIP), ensuring that in the event of a server failure, traffic seamlessly redirects to a healthy server, reducing service interruptions.

Customizability: The provided configurations and explanations are adaptable, enabling you to tailor the solution to your specific lab environment needs.

Usage Guide:

Installation: Start by installing the required software packages on each server, including HAProxy, Keepalived, and an HTTP server for backend functionality.

HAProxy Configuration: Learn how to configure HAProxy to effectively distribute incoming traffic across your backend servers. Understand load balancing algorithms and customize settings as needed.

Keepalived Setup: Discover the setup process for Keepalived, where you'll define the Virtual IP (VIP) and establish automatic failover capabilities. Grasp the concept of priority for server designation.

Service Initiation and Testing: Bring the whole system to life by starting the HAProxy and Keepalived services. Finally, verify the success of your setup by testing it with a web browser.

Important Note:

While this repository provides comprehensive insights into setting up a HAProxy-Keepalived solution on CentOS 7 for educational and lab environments, it's essential to adapt the configurations, security settings, and operational considerations for production environments.

Feel free to engage with the repository through contributions, discussions, and inquiries. By exploring this repository, you're embarking on a journey to deepen your understanding of high availability solutions and their practical implementation.
