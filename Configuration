Lab Environment details:
Operating System: CentOS 7
IP Addresses:
HAProxy/Keepalived Server: 192.168.1.10
Backend Server 1: 192.168.1.11
Backend Server 2: 192.168.1.12
Virtual IP (VIP): 192.168.1.100
Step 1: Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages on each server:

# On HAProxy/Keepalived Server
sudo yum install haproxy keepalived -y

# On Backend Servers (both)
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd


Step 2: Configure HAProxy

#Edit the HAProxy configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

Configure HAProxy to balance traffic between backend servers:

global
    # Logging settings
    log /dev/log local0
    log /dev/log local1 notice
    chroot /var/lib/haproxy

    # Admin socket for stats
    stats socket /run/haproxy/admin.sock mode 660 level admin
    stats timeout 30s

    # User and group settings
    user haproxy
    group haproxy
    daemon

defaults
    log global
    mode http
    option httplog
    option dontlognull
    timeout connect 5000
    timeout client 50000
    timeout server 50000

frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    default_backend http_back

backend http_back
    balance roundrobin
    server backend1 192.168.1.11:80 check
    server backend2 192.168.1.12:80 check


global: Global configuration settings for HAProxy.
defaults: Default settings for frontend and backend sections.
frontend http_front: Defines the frontend section for incoming HTTP requests.
bind *:80: Binds the frontend to listen on all available IP addresses on port 80.
default_backend http_back: Routes incoming requests to the backend named http_back if no other rules match.
backend http_back: Defines the backend section for handling requests.
balance roundrobin: Specifies the round-robin load balancing algorithm.
server backend1 192.168.1.11:80 check: Configures backend server 1 with its IP address and port, and performs health checks.
server backend2 192.168.1.12:80 check: Configures backend server 2 similarly.

Step 3: Configure Keepalived

# Edit the Keepalived configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

Configure Keepalived for Virtual IP failover:

global_defs {
    router_id LVS_DEVEL
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 101  # Use 100 for BACKUP server
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass YOUR_AUTH_PASSWORD
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
}

global_defs: Global definitions for Keepalived.
vrrp_instance VI_1: Configuration for the VRRP instance.
state MASTER: Sets this Keepalived server as the MASTER. Use state BACKUP for the backup server.
interface eth0: Specifies the network interface to use.
virtual_router_id 51: Unique ID for the VRRP instance.
priority 101: Priority of this server as the MASTER. Use a lower value (e.g., 100) for the BACKUP server.
advert_int 1: Advertisement interval in seconds.
authentication: Authentication settings for VRRP communication.
virtual_ipaddress: Specifies the virtual IP address.
Replace YOUR_AUTH_PASSWORD with your chosen authentication password.

Step 4: Start Services

#On HAProxy/Keepalived Server
sudo systemctl enable haproxy
sudo systemctl start haproxy
sudo systemctl enable keepalived
sudo systemctl start keepalived

Step 5: Test the Setup

Open a web browser and access the virtual IP address: http://192.168.1.100
Verify that the traffic is being load balanced between the backend servers.
Perform a failover test by stopping HAProxy on the MASTER server. The BACKUP server should take over the virtual IP address.
Finally! You have successfully set up HAProxy with Keepalived in your lab environment, including the configuration of a Virtual IP (VIP) for high availability and load balancing.
